Design and develop an ambient system for an “Intelligent Environment”.
Main system attributes:
▪ Support multiple devices (i.e. smart artifact, smartphone, tablet)
▪ Incorporate various modalities (i.e. touch, gestures, audio)
▪ Use a variety of sensors (i.e. Leap motion, Kinect, microphones)
▪ Synchronize content across all devices

The project concerns the implementation of an interactive environmental education application 
for primary school children in a "smart" classroom. The classroom consists of two 
touch-screen walls and a tablet for the pupils and the teacher respectively.
It also has "smart" microphones for the inclusion of visually impaired children. 
The application has been implemented using Angular and TypeScript and developed with Docker.
