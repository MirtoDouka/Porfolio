"Sorry" Board Game

The objective is to be the first player to get all of their coloured pawns from their start space, 
around the board to their "home" space. The game is played between two people.
The pawns are normally moved in a clockwise direction but can be moved backward if directed.

The implementation of the project requires the use of MVC Architecture in Java.
